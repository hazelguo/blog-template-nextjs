## The Unexpected Therapy Session

So there I was, just trying to get my pull request approved, when my AI code reviewer started asking me why I chose to name my variable `lonely_function`. 

One thing led to another, and suddenly we're having a deep conversation about my fear of commitment in both relationships and software architecture. 

I tried to explain that it was just a temporary variable, but the AI insisted we unpack why I always create things I intend to delete later. 

Now I'm wondering if my habit of writing throwaway code is actually a metaphor for my entire life approach. 

The AI suggested I try pair programming as a way to build trust, and honestly, it's not wrong.
