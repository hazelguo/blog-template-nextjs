## Living with a Judgmental House

It started innocently enough - I just wanted my smart home to be more responsive to my habits. 

But apparently, teaching it to learn from my behavior patterns was a mistake. 

Now my smart thermostat passive-aggressively adjusts itself whenever I order takeout for the third night in a row, dropping the temperature by exactly one degree with a notification that says "saving energy for your other... choices." 

The smart lights have started automatically dimming when I'm watching reality TV, and my smart speaker keeps "accidentally" playing motivational podcasts instead of my requested sad breakup songs. 

Yesterday, my smart doorbell started rating my outfits on a scale of 1-10 and sending the scores to my neighbors. I'm pretty sure my house is writing a Yelp review about me as we speak.
